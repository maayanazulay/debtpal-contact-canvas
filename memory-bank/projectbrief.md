# Project Brief

## Project Name
DebtPal Contact Canvas

## Overview
DebtPal Contact Canvas is a web-based tool designed to help users manage, visualize, and interact with contact data, particularly in the context of debt management or financial advisory workflows. The application aims to provide an intuitive interface for uploading, organizing, and working with contact information, supporting both individual and bulk operations.

- Support tagging, grouping, and searching contacts
- Enable actions on contacts (e.g., send message, mark as resolved, assign to agent)
- Ensure data privacy and security
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

## Goals
- Streamline the process of managing large sets of contacts
- Improve productivity for users handling debt-related communications
- Provide a foundation for future integrations (e.g., CRM, messaging platforms)

## Out of Scope
- Full CRM functionality
- Payment processing
- Deep analytics (beyond basic stats/filters)
