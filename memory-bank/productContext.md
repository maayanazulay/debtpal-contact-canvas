# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
Managing large volumes of contact data is a common challenge in debt management and financial advisory services. Existing tools are often cumbersome, lack visualization, or are not tailored to the specific workflows of these industries. DebtPal Contact Canvas aims to fill this gap by providing a focused, easy-to-use platform.

## Problems Solved
- Reduces manual effort in organizing and tracking contacts
- Minimizes errors in communication and follow-up
- Provides a clear, visual overview of contact status and actions

## How It Should Work
- Users can upload contact lists or add contacts manually
- Contacts are displayed in an interactive, filterable view
- Recommended Contacts are shown in a modern, swipable gallery (carousel) with smooth transitions and responsive design
- Users can swipe on mobile or use arrows/buttons on desktop to browse contacts
- Users can tag, group, and search contacts easily
- Actions (e.g., messaging, assignment) are accessible directly from the interface

## User Experience Goals
- Fast, intuitive onboarding
- Minimal clicks to perform common actions
- Clear feedback for user actions
- Mobile-friendly and accessible design
- Visually impressive, modern carousel for contact recommendations
